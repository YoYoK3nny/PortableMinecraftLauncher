# Reason for archiving
Q: Why am I archiving this repository?

A: I have stopped work on this.

Q: Couldn't I just delete it?

A: It could still be used as a template for other java-based launchers that work similarly to the java-based Minecraft launcher.

Q: Why did I stop working on this?

A: 3 reasons for this one:

   1. I was encountering a horrible graphical glitch in java-based stuff (which I have since discovered was graphics driver related)
   2. Development of the java-based Minecraft launcher was reaching End-Of-Life.
   3. I have completely stopped using Mojang's launchers for Modded Minecraft.
